## Basic Ecommerce - Frontend

This is the code corresponding to the front end of my ecommerce application, which includes:

- A folder containing the components that are rendered on the pages.
- A folder containing the different pages of the app.
- A 'store' folder with the different contexts that I use in the app through useContext.
- A 'public' folder containing various PNGs used in the app.
- The JSON files and other configuration files of dependencies used for the app's operation.

## Start the app

To use the app, the first step is to install the dependencies using the command:

- npm install

To run the app, the command needed is:

- npm run dev

Once the app is up and running, you can view the results at: [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
